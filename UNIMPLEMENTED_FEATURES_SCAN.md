# Cortiware - Unimplemented Features Scan

**Product**: Cortiware  
**Company**: Robinson AI Systems  
**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Scan Type**: Comprehensive Documentation Review

---

## üîç SCAN METHODOLOGY

Reviewed all documentation files (*.md) and key code files to identify:
1. TODO comments and unimplemented features
2. Stub endpoints returning 501/empty responses
3. Missing pages mentioned in documentation
4. Incomplete integrations
5. Features marked as "needs implementation"

---

## üìã FINDINGS BY CATEGORY

### 1. CLIENT PORTAL PAGES (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: Not Implemented  
**Location**: Mentioned in `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`  
**Impact**: Core business functionality missing

Missing pages that exist in `src/_disabled/pages/` but need App Router migration:
- [ ] `/leads` - Lead management page
- [ ] `/contacts` - Contact management page
- [ ] `/opportunities` - Opportunity pipeline page
- [ ] `/organizations` - Organization management page
- [ ] `/fleet` - Fleet management page
- [ ] `/admin` - Admin settings page
- [ ] `/reports` - Reporting page

**Recommendation**: These are core CRM features. Should be prioritized after production infrastructure is set up.

---

### 2. PROVIDER PORTAL PAGES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status**: Partially Complete  
**Location**: `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`  
**Impact**: Provider operations limited

Missing pages:
- [ ] `/provider/clients` - Full client management interface (currently basic)
- [ ] `/provider/billing` - Full billing & revenue interface (currently basic)
- [ ] `/provider/federation` - Federation management interface (stub only)

**Current State**:
- Dashboard: ‚úÖ Complete (with mocks)
- Settings: ‚úÖ Complete
- Analytics: ‚úÖ Complete (with mocks)
- Monetization: ‚úÖ Complete (implemented in this session)
- Metrics: ‚úÖ Complete (implemented in this session)
- Audit: ‚úÖ Complete (implemented in this session)

**Recommendation**: Provider portal is mostly complete. Missing pages are lower priority.

---

### 3. API ENDPOINTS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status**: Stubs Only  
**Location**: `src/app/api/v2/`  
**Impact**: API consumers will get 501 errors

Stub endpoints:
- [ ] `/api/v2/leads` - Returns 501 Not Implemented
- [ ] `/api/v2/opportunities` - Returns empty array
- [ ] `/api/v2/organizations` - Not fully implemented

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement lead creation with deduplication
- [ ] Implement lead listing with pagination
- [ ] Implement opportunity CRUD
- [ ] Implement organization CRUD
- [ ] Wire to Prisma database

**Recommendation**: Implement when client portal pages are built (they'll need these APIs).

---

### 4. GUARDRAILS BACKEND (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (implemented in this session)  
**Location**: `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`, `src/lib/idempotency-store.ts`

Previously marked as TODO:
- [x] Redis/Vercel KV backend for rate limiting (‚úÖ implemented with fallback)
- [x] Redis/Vercel KV backend for idempotency store (‚úÖ implemented with fallback)
- [ ] Redis/Vercel KV backend for nonce store (not yet needed)
- [x] Audit log viewer in provider/developer portals (‚úÖ implemented)

**Note**: Redis support is now implemented with automatic in-memory fallback. Nonce store not yet needed.

---

### 5. DATABASE SCHEMA (NEEDS REVIEW)

**Status**: Needs Review  
**Location**: `prisma/schema.prisma`  
**Impact**: May be missing tables or constraints

Tasks from documentation:
- [ ] Review Prisma schema for completeness
- [x] Activity table exists (used for metrics tracking)
- [ ] Add single-Owner constraint migration (business rule)
- [ ] Run migrations in controlled window
- [ ] Seed test data

**Recommendation**: Schema appears complete for current features. Single-Owner constraint is a business rule that should be enforced at application level or via migration.

---

### 6. TESTING (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**Status**: Unit tests complete, integration/E2E missing  
**Location**: `tests/unit/`  
**Impact**: Limited test coverage

Current state:
- [x] Unit tests for core features (42/42 passing)
- [x] Negative path tests (implemented in this session)
- [ ] Unit tests for wrappers (rate limit, idempotency, HMAC, audit)
- [ ] E2E smoke tests per E2E_FEDERATION_SMOKE spec
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test 401/403/429/409 error paths (partially done)

**Recommendation**: Current test coverage is good for core features. Additional tests can be added as new features are built.

---

### 7. DESIGN SYSTEM EXPANSION (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status**: Basic system in place  
**Location**: Theme system  
**Impact**: Limited UI component library

Current state:
- [x] 15 premium themes across 3 categories
- [x] CSS variables for theming
- [ ] Reusable component library (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- [ ] Storybook or component documentation
- [ ] Accessibility testing

**Recommendation**: Current theme system is sufficient. Component library can be built incrementally.

---

### 8. INTEGRATIONS (DISABLED/INCOMPLETE)

**Status**: Disabled, in `src/_disabled/`  
**Location**: `src/_disabled/pages/api/integrations/`  
**Impact**: No external data sources

Found integrations:
- Fort Collins Permits API (production ready, but disabled)
- Weld County Permits (stub)
- Denver Permits (stub)

**Note**: These appear to be for a specific use case (construction permits). May not be relevant to current Cortiware product.

**Recommendation**: Review if these integrations are still needed for the product vision.

---

### 9. DOCUMENTATION (MOSTLY COMPLETE)

**Status**: Comprehensive  
**Location**: Various *.md files  
**Impact**: Good documentation coverage

Current state:
- [x] Architecture docs
- [x] Handoff docs
- [x] API specs (in Reference/)
- [x] Production readiness guide
- [x] Deployment checklist
- [ ] Inline code documentation (partial)
- [ ] README for each major module
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

**Recommendation**: Documentation is excellent. Additional inline comments can be added as needed.

---

### 10. MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS (FROM CHECKLIST)

**Status**: Not yet implemented  
**Location**: `SONNET_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md`  
**Impact**: UX improvements

Remaining MEDIUM priority items:
- [ ] Inline edit for coupons/offers (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Org search with pagination in overrides (2-3 hours)
- [ ] API reference generation from contracts (3-4 hours)

**Recommendation**: These are polish items that can be implemented post-launch.

---

### 11. LOW PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

**Status**: Not yet implemented  
**Location**: Various checklists  
**Impact**: Nice-to-have features

Items:
- [ ] Schema constraint validation tests (1-2 hours)

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTIONABLE ITEMS

Based on this scan, here are items I can implement RIGHT NOW without external dependencies:

### Can Implement Now (No External Dependencies)
1. ‚úÖ **API Reference Generation** - Parse contract snapshots, generate markdown
2. ‚úÖ **Inline Edit UI for Coupons/Offers** - Add edit buttons and forms
3. ‚úÖ **Schema Constraint Validation Tests** - Test override type rules
4. ‚úÖ **Audit Log Export** - Add CSV export endpoint

### Cannot Implement Now (Requires External Setup)
- Client Portal Pages (need product requirements and design)
- API v2 Endpoints (need to understand business logic)
- Integrations (need API keys and requirements)
- CSRF Protection (need to test with real forms)
- Performance Optimization (need production load data)

---

## üìù NOTES

### What's Actually Missing vs What's Documented as TODO

**Actually Missing (High Impact)**:
- Client portal CRM pages
- API v2 endpoint implementations

**Documented as TODO but Actually Complete**:
- ‚úÖ Redis support (implemented with fallback)
- ‚úÖ Audit log viewers (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Negative path tests (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Conversion metrics dashboard (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Audit log filtering UI (implemented)

**Documented as TODO but Low Priority**:
- Design system expansion
- Additional testing
- Security enhancements
- Performance optimization

### Conclusion

The Cortiware system is **production-ready for its current scope** (onboarding & monetization). The main missing pieces are:
1. **Client portal CRM features** - This is a separate product phase
2. **API v2 implementations** - Needed to support CRM features

All critical infrastructure is in place. The system can be deployed and used for onboarding, subscription management, and provider operations.
