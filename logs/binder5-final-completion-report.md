## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Architecture Patterns**
- **BINDER Contract Format**: Standardized request/response format with request_id, tenant_id, bu_id, actor, payload, idempotency_key
- **Middleware Stack**: 
  - `withAudience('tenant'|'provider'|'portal', handler)` for JWT audience isolation
  - `withIdempotency({ headerName: 'X-Idempotency-Key' }, handler)` for idempotency
  - `auditService.logBinderEvent()` for centralized audit logging
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Row-Level Security (RLS) with orgId filtering
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control with OWNER, MANAGER, STAFF, ACCOUNTANT, EMPLOYEE roles
- **Offline-First**: Field PWA supports offline queue with SyncQueue model

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking with Zod validation schemas
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive 400/403/404/422/500 error responses
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all mutations
- **Idempotency**: All endpoints support idempotent operations
- **Validation**: Domain-specific business rules and field validation

### **Database Integration**
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **PostgreSQL**: Production-ready relational database
- **Audit Logging**: AuditLog2 model for comprehensive tracking
- **Soft Deletes**: Archived boolean or status field patterns
- **Version Tracking**: Optimistic locking with version field increment
