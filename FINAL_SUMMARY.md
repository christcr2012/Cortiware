## 🎯 KEY FEATURES DELIVERED

### Onboarding System
1. **Invite-based onboarding**
   - HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with expiration
   - Atomic org + owner creation in transaction
   - Invite reuse prevention
   - Stripe customer + subscription creation (optional)

2. **Public onboarding**
   - Self-serve signup when enabled
   - Optional coupon code support
   - Default plan/price from global config
   - Same Stripe integration as invite flow

3. **Security**
   - Rate limiting (10 req/10s on auth endpoints)
   - Idempotency keys required
   - Token expiration validation
   - Invite single-use enforcement

### Monetization System
1. **Provider controls**
   - Plans & Prices management
   - Invite generation with copy-to-clipboard
   - Coupons (percentOff, amountOffCents)
   - Offers (percentOff, amountOffCents, plan-specific)
   - Tenant price overrides
   - Global defaults (default plan/price, trial days, public toggle)

2. **Discount logic**
   - Best-benefit algorithm (max discount wins)
   - Coupon vs Offer comparison
   - Applied during onboarding
   - Recorded in subscription meta

3. **Pagination & Filtering**
   - Coupons: filter by code, active; paginate with limit/offset
   - Offers: filter by active; paginate with limit/offset
   - Delete support for both

### Observability System
1. **Audit logging**
   - Onboarding events (verify, accepted, failed, public_attempt, public_success)
   - Monetization changes (create, update, delete for coupons/offers/overrides)
   - Provider audit viewer with entity/orgId filters
   - Developer audit viewer with entity/action/limit filters
   - FK-safe implementation (skips when orgId missing)
   - Unit test guard (UNIT_TESTS=1 disables writes)

2. **Metrics tracking**
   - Funnel events (invite_created, invite_accepted, public_attempt, public_success)
   - Conversion metrics dashboard
   - 30-day and 7-day views
   - Alert thresholds (<50% conversion)
   - Recommendations based on performance

3. **Conversion dashboard**
   - KPI cards for each funnel stage
   - Conversion rate calculations
   - Visual alerts for low performance
   - Actionable recommendations

### Owner Portal Enhancements
1. **Subscription page**
   - Payment method status (Yes/No)
   - Trial nudge when applicable
   - Link to Billing Portal

## 📝 NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

### Branding
- Product name is now **Cortiware** (updated in package.json, docs)
- Company name is **Robinson AI Systems**
- All references to StreamFlow/WorkStream have been updated

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests cover happy paths and negative paths
- Audit/metrics writes disabled in tests (UNIT_TESTS=1)
- FK-safe implementation prevents constraint violations
- All 42 tests passing consistently

### Architecture Decisions
- Audit logging uses existing AuditLog model (orgId FK)
- Metrics tracking uses Activity model (orgId FK)
- Both services skip writes when orgId is missing (e.g., pre-org creation events)
- Provider/developer audit viewers use existing audit.service.ts

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing MEDIUM priority enhancements
- Plan production infrastructure migration (Redis, monitoring)
- Schedule security audit and penetration testing
- Prepare deployment runbook
