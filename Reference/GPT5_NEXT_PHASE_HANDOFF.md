## What Sonnet 4.5 Built

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added 5 new models for provider operations:

```prisma
model Activity {
  // Cross-entity timeline tracking
  // Used for: audit trails, activity feeds, event correlation
}

model Subscription {
  // Plan lifecycle management
  // Used for: MRR/ARR calculations, churn analysis, renewals
}

model UsageMeter {
  // Usage-based billing tracking
  // Used for: metering, rating, billable totals
}

model AddonPurchase {
  // One-off purchases and refunds
  // Used for: SKU tracking, revenue attribution
}

model FederationKey {
  // HMAC key registry for federation
  // Used for: secure API authentication
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Activity model uses flexible `actorType` (system/user/machine) + `entityType`/`entityId` pattern
- UsageMeter intentionally simple (no `rated` field) - rating logic in background jobs
- All models include proper indexes for query performance
- Decimal types used for financial precision (Payment.amount, AiUsageEvent.costUsd)

### 2. Provider Services Layer

**Location**: `src/services/provider/`

Created 7 comprehensive services with proper Prisma field mappings:

1. **subscriptions.service.ts**
   - MRR/ARR calculations
   - Churn rate analysis
   - Upcoming renewals
   - Plan change tracking

2. **usage.service.ts**
   - Usage metering summaries
   - Meter-specific breakdowns
   - Billable totals estimation
   - Rating window management

3. **addons.service.ts**
   - SKU purchase tracking
   - Refund management
   - Revenue attribution
   - Top SKU analysis

4. **incidents.service.ts**
   - SLA metrics (placeholder implementation)
   - Uses Activity records as interim solution
   - TODO: Dedicated Incident model needed

5. **billing.service.ts**
   - Revenue by stream (leads, subscriptions, usage, addons, AI)
   - Unbilled leads tracking
   - Dunning queue management
   - Payment reconciliation

6. **analytics.service.ts**
   - Revenue trends

   - Cohort retention
   - Revenue mix by stream

7. **audit.service.ts**
   - Event feed with filters
   - Entity audit trails
   - Search functionality
   - Statistics by period

**Critical Fixes Applied**:
- Corrected Prisma field names (Payment.amount vs amountCents, AuditLog.entity vs actor)
- Proper Decimal-to-cents conversion: `Math.round(parseFloat(amount.toString()) * 100)`
- Fixed enum values (LeadStatus.CONVERTED not 'converted')
- Removed non-existent fields (Payment.metadata, AuditLog.ipAddress)

### 3. Provider Portal Pages

**Location**: `src/app/(provider)/provider/`

Created 5 new pages with consistent UI patterns:

1. **/provider/subscriptions**
   - KPI row: Active, Trialing, MRR, ARR, Churn Rate
   - Filters: All, Active, Trialing, Canceled
   - Table: Org, Plan, Status, Price, Started, Renews
   - Pagination with cursor-based loading

2. **/provider/usage**

   - Pagination

4. **/provider/incidents**
   - KPI row: Open, Resolved, Escalated, Avg Resolution Time, SLA Breaches
   - SLA Compliance metrics
   - Placeholder UI (uses Activity records)
   - TODO: Full incident management system

5. **/provider/audit**
   - KPI row: Total Events, Last 24h, Top Entity, Active Users
   - Top Entities breakdown
   - Table: Time, Org, Entity, Field, Change (old→new)
   - Pagination

**UI Patterns**:
- Futuristic green accent theme (var(--brand-primary))
- Glass morphism backgrounds (var(--glass-bg))
- Consistent KPI card layout
- Filter buttons with active state
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Pagination with "Load More" pattern

**Navigation Update**:
- Organized into 3 sections: Management, Revenue Streams, Operations
- All new pages added to ProviderShellClient.tsx

### 4. Federation Ingestion Routes

**Location**: `src/app/api/federation/`

Created 2 new ingestion endpoints:

1. **POST /api/federation/events**
   - Generic event ingestion
   - Maps event types to Activity records
   - Supports: lead.*, invoice.*, subscription.*, usage.*, addon.*, incident.*
   - Middleware: withRateLimit('api') → withHmacAuth() → withAuditLog()
   - Idempotency: Full conflict detection with 409 responses

   - Processes UsageMeter records
   - Applies rating configuration (price per unit)
   - Calculates billable amounts
   - TODO: Create invoice line items
   - Usage: `npx tsx scripts/nightly-rating.ts [--dry-run]`

2. **dunning-retries.ts**
   - Finds unpaid invoices
   - Retries on days 1, 3, 7, 14 after issuance

## What GPT-5 Should Build Next

### CRITICAL PRIORITY: Make Provider Portal Fully Functional

**Goal**: Design everything needed to make the current provider portal pages actually work end-to-end with real data flow.

#### 1. Stripe Payment Processing Integration (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Context**: Provider-side payment processing will use Stripe. Stripe credentials are already configured in `.env.local`.

**Environment Variables (Already Configured in .env.local)**:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe test secret key (sk_test_...)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe test publishable key (pk_test_...)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret (whsec_...)

**Note**: These are TEST mode keys. For production deployment, replace with LIVE mode keys from Stripe dashboard.

**Stripe Account Details**:
- Account ID: acct_1RzjtY7lvYBvNgEX (visible in Stripe dashboard)
- Test mode is enabled
- Webhook endpoint needs to be configured in Stripe dashboard: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`

**Design Requirements**:

A. **Stripe Service Layer** (`src/services/provider/stripe.service.ts`)
   - Initialize Stripe client with secret key
   - Create customer in Stripe when org is created
   - Create subscription in Stripe → sync to local Subscription model
   - Create usage records in Stripe → sync to local UsageMeter model
   - Process one-time charges → sync to local AddonPurchase model
   - Handle payment intents and payment methods
   - Implement retry logic for failed API calls

B. **Webhook Handler** (`src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
   - Verify webhook signature using STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - Handle events:
     * `customer.subscription.created` → create Subscription record
     * `customer.subscription.updated` → update Subscription record
     * `customer.subscription.deleted` → mark Subscription as canceled
     * `invoice.payment_succeeded` → create Payment record
     * `invoice.payment_failed` → trigger dunning workflow
     * `charge.refunded` → update AddonPurchase status
   - Create Activity records for all events
   - Idempotent processing (check if event already processed)

C. **Payment Model Enhancement**
   - Add `status` field: 'pending' | 'succeeded' | 'failed' | 'refunded'
   - Add `stripePaymentIntentId` field
   - Add `stripeChargeId` field
   - Add `failureReason` field
   - Add `retryCount` field

   - Handle rating and invoicing through Stripe
   - Support multiple meter types (API calls, storage, etc.)

F. **Invoice Generation**
   - Create invoices in Stripe
   - Sync invoice data to local Invoice model
   - Add `stripeInvoiceId` field to Invoice model
   - Generate invoice line items from:
     * Subscription charges
