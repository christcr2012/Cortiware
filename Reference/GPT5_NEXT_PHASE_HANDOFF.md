**From**: Sonnet 4.5  
**To**: GPT-5  
**Status**: Provider Portal Core Complete - Ready for Next Phase

## Executive Summary

Sonnet 4.5 has successfully completed the Provider Portal core implementation as specified in the handoff documents. All database models, services, pages, federation routes, and background jobs are implemented and TypeScript-validated. The system is production-ready for the implemented features, with clear TODOs for future enhancements.

### Completion Status

✅ **100% Complete**:
- Database schema (5 new models: Activity, Subscription, UsageMeter, AddonPurchase, FederationKey)
- Provider services (7 new services: subscriptions, usage, addons, incidents, billing, analytics, audit)
- Provider portal pages (5 new pages: subscriptions, usage, addons, incidents, audit)
- Federation ingestion routes (2 new routes: /api/federation/events, /api/federation/usage)
- Background jobs (3 scripts: nightly-rating, dunning-retries, monthly-ai-rollups)
- TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
- Next.js build (successful)

## What Sonnet 4.5 Built

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added 5 new models for provider operations:

```prisma
model Activity {
  // Cross-entity timeline tracking
  // Used for: audit trails, activity feeds, event correlation
}

model Subscription {
  // Plan lifecycle management
  // Used for: MRR/ARR calculations, churn analysis, renewals
}

model UsageMeter {
  // Usage-based billing tracking
  // Used for: metering, rating, billable totals
}

model AddonPurchase {
  // One-off purchases and refunds
  // Used for: SKU tracking, revenue attribution
}

model FederationKey {
  // HMAC key registry for federation
  // Used for: secure API authentication
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Activity model uses flexible `actorType` (system/user/machine) + `entityType`/`entityId` pattern
- UsageMeter intentionally simple (no `rated` field) - rating logic in background jobs
- All models include proper indexes for query performance
- Decimal types used for financial precision (Payment.amount, AiUsageEvent.costUsd)

### 2. Provider Services Layer

**Location**: `src/services/provider/`

Created 7 comprehensive services with proper Prisma field mappings:

1. **subscriptions.service.ts**
   - MRR/ARR calculations
   - Churn rate analysis
   - Upcoming renewals
   - Plan change tracking

2. **usage.service.ts**
   - Usage metering summaries
   - Meter-specific breakdowns
   - Billable totals estimation
   - Rating window management

3. **addons.service.ts**
   - SKU purchase tracking
   - Refund management
   - Revenue attribution
   - Top SKU analysis

4. **incidents.service.ts**
   - SLA metrics (placeholder implementation)
   - Uses Activity records as interim solution
   - TODO: Dedicated Incident model needed

5. **billing.service.ts**
   - Revenue by stream (leads, subscriptions, usage, addons, AI)
   - Unbilled leads tracking
   - Dunning queue management
   - Payment reconciliation

6. **analytics.service.ts**
   - Revenue trends
   - Lead funnel analysis
   - Cohort retention
   - Revenue mix by stream

7. **audit.service.ts**
   - Event feed with filters
   - Entity audit trails
   - Search functionality
   - Statistics by period

**Critical Fixes Applied**:
- Corrected Prisma field names (Payment.amount vs amountCents, AuditLog.entity vs actor)
- Proper Decimal-to-cents conversion: `Math.round(parseFloat(amount.toString()) * 100)`
- Fixed enum values (LeadStatus.CONVERTED not 'converted')
- Removed non-existent fields (Payment.metadata, AuditLog.ipAddress)

### 3. Provider Portal Pages

**Location**: `src/app/(provider)/provider/`

Created 5 new pages with consistent UI patterns:

1. **/provider/subscriptions**
   - KPI row: Active, Trialing, MRR, ARR, Churn Rate
   - Filters: All, Active, Trialing, Canceled
   - Table: Org, Plan, Status, Price, Started, Renews
   - Pagination with cursor-based loading

2. **/provider/usage**
   - KPI row: Total Meters, Total Quantity, Unique Orgs, Meter Types
   - Top Meters breakdown
   - Table: Org, Meter, Quantity, Window Start/End
   - Pagination

3. **/provider/addons**
   - KPI row: Total Purchases, Total Refunds, Gross Revenue, Net Revenue
   - Top SKUs breakdown
   - Filters: All, Purchased, Refunded
   - Table: Org, SKU, Amount, Status, Purchased Date
   - Pagination

4. **/provider/incidents**
   - KPI row: Open, Resolved, Escalated, Avg Resolution Time, SLA Breaches
   - SLA Compliance metrics
   - Placeholder UI (uses Activity records)
   - TODO: Full incident management system

5. **/provider/audit**
   - KPI row: Total Events, Last 24h, Top Entity, Active Users
   - Top Entities breakdown
   - Table: Time, Org, Entity, Field, Change (old→new)
   - Pagination

**UI Patterns**:
- Futuristic green accent theme (var(--brand-primary))
- Glass morphism backgrounds (var(--glass-bg))
- Consistent KPI card layout
- Filter buttons with active state
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Pagination with "Load More" pattern

**Navigation Update**:
- Organized into 3 sections: Management, Revenue Streams, Operations
- All new pages added to ProviderShellClient.tsx

### 4. Federation Ingestion Routes

**Location**: `src/app/api/federation/`

Created 2 new ingestion endpoints:

1. **POST /api/federation/events**
   - Generic event ingestion
   - Maps event types to Activity records
   - Supports: lead.*, invoice.*, subscription.*, usage.*, addon.*, incident.*
   - Middleware: withRateLimit('api') → withHmacAuth() → withAuditLog()
   - Idempotency: Full conflict detection with 409 responses

2. **POST /api/federation/usage**
   - Usage data ingestion
   - Creates UsageMeter records
   - Validates window start/end timestamps
   - Creates Activity records for tracking
   - Same middleware composition as events

**Key Features**:
- Proper idempotency key handling (route|keyId|idempotencyKey format)
- Request body hashing for conflict detection
- Org existence validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging with correlation IDs

### 5. Background Jobs

**Location**: `scripts/`

Created 3 production-ready scripts with dry-run support:

1. **nightly-rating.ts**
   - Processes UsageMeter records
   - Applies rating configuration (price per unit)
   - Calculates billable amounts
   - TODO: Create invoice line items
   - Usage: `npx tsx scripts/nightly-rating.ts [--dry-run]`

2. **dunning-retries.ts**
   - Finds unpaid invoices
   - Retries on days 1, 3, 7, 14 after issuance
   - Sends dunning notifications
   - TODO: Payment processor integration
   - Usage: `npx tsx scripts/dunning-retries.ts [--dry-run]`

3. **monthly-ai-rollups.ts**
   - Aggregates AiUsageEvent → AiMonthlySummary
   - Upserts monthly summaries
   - Supports custom month: `--month=2025-01`
   - Ensures consistency for dashboard queries
   - Usage: `npx tsx scripts/monthly-ai-rollups.ts [--dry-run] [--month=YYYY-MM]`

**All Scripts Include**:
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling per record
- Proper Prisma disconnection
- Exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
