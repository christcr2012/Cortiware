# Security Improvements Summary

## 🎉 All Security Prevention Measures Implemented!

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Commit:** `ec1427e8e9`

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Pre-Commit Hooks with Secret Detection ✅

**Tools Installed:**
- `husky` - Git hooks manager
- `@commitlint/cli` - Commit message linting
- `@commitlint/config-conventional` - Conventional commits
- Custom secret detection script

**Files Created:**
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `scripts/check-secrets.js` - Secret detection script (300+ lines)

**What It Does:**
- Scans all staged files before commit
- Detects 15+ types of secrets:
  - High entropy hex strings (64+ chars)
  - API keys and tokens
  - AWS credentials
  - Private keys
  - Database URLs with passwords
  - JWT tokens
  - Stripe keys
  - GitHub tokens
  - Vercel tokens
  - Generic secrets and passwords
- Blocks commits if secrets detected
- Provides clear error messages with file/line numbers
- Categorizes findings by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM)

**Example Output:**
```
🔍 Scanning staged files for secrets...
📁 Scanning 5 staged file(s)...

🚨 POTENTIAL SECRETS DETECTED!

🔴 CRITICAL SEVERITY:
  apps/tenant-app/src/config.ts:12
    Pattern: AWS Access Key
    Match: AKIA1234567890ABCDEF

❌ COMMIT BLOCKED - Potential secrets detected
```

### 2. Environment Variable Templates ✅

**Files Updated:**
- `.env.example` (root) - Already existed, verified
- `apps/provider-portal/.env.example` - Already existed
- `apps/tenant-app/.env.example` - Already existed

**What They Contain:**
- Placeholder values (never actual secrets)
- Clear documentation on how to generate secrets
- Security warnings
- Usage instructions
- Examples for all required variables

**Example:**
```bash
# Generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
AUTH_TICKET_HMAC_SECRET="<generate-64-char-hex-string>"
```

---

### 3. Enhanced .gitignore ✅

**Added Patterns:**
```gitignore
# Generated secrets and deployment scripts
docs/deployment/GENERATED_SECRETS.md
docs/security/*_SECRETS.md
scripts/set-env-vars.*
scripts/set-vercel-env.*

# Environment variables (all variants)
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
.env.staging
.env.staging.local

# Backup files
*.env.backup
*.env.bak

# Private keys and certificates
*.pem
*.key
*.p12
*.pfx
*.crt
*.cer

# Password files
passwords.txt
secrets.txt
credentials.txt

# Database dumps
*.sql
*.dump
*.backup
```

**Total:** 40+ new patterns added

---

### 4. CI/CD Secret Scanning ✅

**Files Created:**
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Security scanning workflow
- `.gitleaks.toml` - Gitleaks configuration (250+ lines)

**What It Does:**
- Runs on every push and pull request
- Runs daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled scan)
- Three parallel jobs:
  1. **Secret Detection** (Gitleaks)
  2. **Dependency Vulnerability Scan** (npm audit)
  3. **Code Quality** (ESLint + TypeScript)
- Uploads reports as artifacts
- Fails build if secrets detected

**Gitleaks Configuration:**
- 15+ custom rules for Cortiware-specific secrets
- Global allowlist for documentation and templates
- Entropy-based detection
- Supports all major secret types

---

### 5. Secure Deployment Documentation ✅

**File Created:**
- `docs/security/SECURE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (300+ lines)

**Contents:**
- Core security principles (Never/Always rules)
- Secret management best practices
- Secret generation commands
- Environment setup procedures
- Deployment checklists
- Secret rotation procedures
- Incident response guidelines
- Monitoring and auditing procedures
- Security tools documentation

**Key Sections:**
1. Core Security Principles
2. Secret Management
3. Environment Setup
4. Deployment Checklist
5. Secret Rotation
6. Incident Response
7. Monitoring & Auditing
8. Best Practices Summary

---

### 6. CI/CD Fixes ✅

**Problem:** TypeScript errors in CI due to missing Prisma client

**Root Cause:**
- CI was generating Prisma client from wrong schema location
- Used `--schema=apps/provider-portal/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Should use root `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Fix:**
```yaml
# Before
- name: Generate Prisma Client
  run: npx prisma generate --schema=apps/provider-portal/prisma/schema.prisma

# After
- name: Generate Prisma Client
  run: npx prisma generate
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All 10 packages pass typecheck
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ RefreshToken model properly generated
- ✅ CI/CD should now pass
