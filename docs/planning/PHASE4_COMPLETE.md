# Phase-4 Completion Summary

Date: 2025-10-07
Status: ✅ Complete

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Routing Optimization Enhancements
Extended packages/routing/src/engine.ts with:
- RoutingOptions type with detourCoefficient and maxStops parameters
- Updated planSimple() to accept optional RoutingOptions
- detourCoefficient: multiplier for distance-based sorting (default 1.0)
- maxStops: limit on stops per route (default unlimited)

### 2. Property Tests & Performance Smoke
Created tests/unit/routing_optimization.test.ts (4 tests):
1. Detour coefficient affects route order
2. maxStops limits route length
3. Capacity invariant (never goes negative, dumps inserted)
4. Performance smoke (1000 stops completes < 5 seconds)

### 3. Landfill Catalog Tools
Created scripts/routing/search_landfills.ts:
- Search landfills by material acceptance
- Usage: `tsx scripts/routing/search_landfills.ts <material> [landfills.json]`
- Example: `tsx scripts/routing/search_landfills.ts msw out/landfills.import.json`

## Verification

All tests passing: **66/66** ✅
- Previous tests: 62/62
- New routing.optimization tests: 4/4

Commands verified:
```bash
npm run test:unit  # 66/66 passed
tsx scripts/routing/search_landfills.ts msw out/landfills.import.json
```

## Constraints Maintained
- ✅ No new HTTP routes (36-route cap preserved)
- ✅ No paid services introduced
- ✅ All logic in packages/* and scripts/*

## Files Created
- tests/unit/routing_optimization.test.ts
- scripts/routing/search_landfills.ts
- docs/planning/PHASE4_COMPLETE.md (this file)

## Files Modified
- packages/routing/src/engine.ts (added RoutingOptions, updated planSimple signature)
- tests/unit/run.ts (added routing_optimization test)

## Next Steps
Ready for Phase-5: UX Wiring (No New Routes)
