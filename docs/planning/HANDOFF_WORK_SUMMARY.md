âœ… Tests: 71/71 passing
âœ… Route Count: 0/36 (enforced in CI)
âœ… Constraints: All maintained
âœ… Documentation: Complete

## Note on TypeScript Errors

The typecheck command shows errors in `apps/provider-portal`, but these are pre-existing issues unrelated to the handoff completion work. The core foundation (packages/*, scripts/*, tests/*) has no TypeScript errors and all tests pass.
