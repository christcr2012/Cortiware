# Phase-3 Completion Summary

Date: 2025-10-07
Status: ✅ Complete

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Agreements Rule-Eval Module
Created packages/agreements with:
- Type definitions: AgreementRule, AgreementEvent, ChargeLine, ChargesResult
- evaluateRule(): evaluates single rule against event with filter support (gt, gte, lt, lte, eq)
- evaluateAgreement(): evaluates all rules and produces charges JSON
- Action types supported: flat_fee, per_unit, percentage

### 2. Wallet Module
Created packages/wallet with:
- Type definitions: WalletBalance, WalletTransaction, WalletStore
- InMemoryWalletStore: in-memory implementation for dev/testing
- debitOrInvoice(): wallet-first settlement function
  - Returns { ok: true, newBalance } if sufficient balance
  - Returns { ok: false, status: 402, invoice } if insufficient

### 3. Integrated Pipeline
Created scripts/agreements/eval_and_settle.ts:
- Loads agreement JSON and event JSON
- Evaluates rules against event
- Attempts wallet debit or returns 402 invoice
- Writes result to out/eval_and_settle.result.json

Sample event files created:
- scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_35days.json (500 cents balance)
- scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_35days_no_balance.json (0 cents balance)
- scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_20days.json (within grace period)

### 4. Comprehensive Tests
Created tests/unit/agreements_eval.test.ts (5 tests):
1. Flat_fee rule matches when value > threshold
2. Rule does not match when value <= threshold
3. Per_unit rule calculates correctly
4. Multiple rules evaluation
5. Percentage action type

Created tests/unit/wallet.test.ts (5 tests):
1. Debit succeeds when balance sufficient
2. Returns 402 when balance insufficient
3. Transaction recorded on debit
4. Zero balance returns 402
5. Exact balance debit succeeds

Wired into tests/unit/run.ts

## Verification

All tests passing: **62/62** ✅
- Previous tests: 52/52
- New agreements.eval tests: 5/5
- New wallet tests: 5/5

Commands verified:
```bash
npm run test:unit  # 62/62 passed

# Wallet debit scenario (balance sufficient)
npx tsx scripts/agreements/eval_and_settle.ts AGREEMENTS_examples/rolloff_grace_30days.json scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_35days.json
# Output: ✅ Wallet debited. New balance: 400 cents

# 402 scenario (balance insufficient)
npx tsx scripts/agreements/eval_and_settle.ts AGREEMENTS_examples/rolloff_grace_30days.json scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_35days_no_balance.json
# Output: ❌ HTTP 402 - Payment Required (invoice JSON)

# Grace period scenario (no charge)
npx tsx scripts/agreements/eval_and_settle.ts AGREEMENTS_examples/rolloff_grace_30days.json scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_20days.json
# Output: ✅ Wallet debited. New balance: 1000 cents (no charge applied)
```

## Constraints Maintained
- ✅ No new HTTP routes (36-route cap preserved)
- ✅ No paid services introduced
- ✅ Wallet/HTTP 402 behavior implemented as specified
- ✅ All logic in packages/* and scripts/* (no route sprawl)

## Files Created
- packages/agreements/src/index.ts
- packages/agreements/package.json
- packages/agreements/tsconfig.json
- packages/wallet/src/index.ts
- packages/wallet/package.json
- packages/wallet/tsconfig.json
- scripts/agreements/eval_and_settle.ts
- scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_35days.json
- scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_35days_no_balance.json
- scripts/agreements/samples/event_idle_20days.json
- tests/unit/agreements_eval.test.ts
- tests/unit/wallet.test.ts
- docs/planning/PHASE3_COMPLETE.md (this file)

## Files Modified
- tests/unit/run.ts (added agreements_eval and wallet tests)
- docs/PHASE1_RUN.md (added Phase-3 section)

## Architecture Highlights
- Pure functions for rule evaluation (no side effects)
- Wallet store abstraction (InMemoryWalletStore for dev, can swap for Prisma/DB)
- Clear separation: eval → charges → settlement
- Wallet-first logic: debit if possible, else 402 invoice

## Next Steps
Ready for Phase-4: Routing Optimization
