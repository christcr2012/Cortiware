# Phase-6 Completion Summary

Date: 2025-10-07
Status: ✅ Complete

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Cost Budgets Documentation
Created docs/COST_BUDGETS.md:
- Provider baseline: ≤ $100/month
- Default to local/open-source implementations
- Wallet/HTTP 402 for all costed actions
- Cost categories and monthly budgets
- Opt-in paid services configuration
- Cost optimization tips

### 2. Local Cost Dashboard
Created scripts/cost/dashboard.ts:
- Tracks wallet debits by category
- Aggregates monthly spend
- Displays budget utilization %
- Alerts at 80%, 95%, 100% thresholds
- No external services required

### 3. Route Count Verification
Created scripts/ci/verify_route_count.ts:
- Scans apps/*/app/**/route.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
- Enforces 36-route cap
- Exits with error if cap exceeded
- Can be integrated into CI pipeline

### 4. Performance Documentation
Created docs/PERFORMANCE.md:
- Performance budgets for routing, agreements, importers, wallet
- Locally reproducible benchmarks
- Optimization guidelines
- Profiling instructions
- Known bottlenecks and future optimizations

## Verification

Route count check: **✅ PASSED (0/36)**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/ci/verify_route_count.ts
# Output: ✅ PASSED: Route count within cap (0/36)
```

All tests still passing: **70/70** ✅

Commands verified:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/ci/verify_route_count.ts  # Route cap check
npx tsx scripts/cost/dashboard.ts  # Cost dashboard (no entries yet)
```

## Constraints Maintained
- ✅ No new HTTP routes (36-route cap preserved and verified)
- ✅ No paid services by default
- ✅ Provider baseline ≤ $100/month documented
- ✅ All monitoring/dashboards are local (no external services)

## Files Created
- docs/COST_BUDGETS.md
- scripts/cost/dashboard.ts
- scripts/ci/verify_route_count.ts
- docs/PERFORMANCE.md
- docs/planning/PHASE6_COMPLETE.md (this file)

## Files Modified
- package.json (added glob dev dependency)

## CI Integration

Add to CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Verify route count
  run: npx tsx scripts/ci/verify_route_count.ts
```
