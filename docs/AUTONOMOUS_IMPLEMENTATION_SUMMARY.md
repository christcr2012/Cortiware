# Autonomous Implementation Summary

Date: ${new Date().toISOString()}
Branch: phases/4-7-completion

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Monitoring

### Services Added
- NeonPostgresMonitor (VERCEL_POSTGRES): STORAGE_GB, CONNECTIONS, LATENCY_MS, COST_USD (storage estimate)
- AiUsageMonitor (AI_OPENAI, AI_CREDITS): COST_USD, USAGE_PERCENT

### Metrics Tracked (new)
- Postgres: STORAGE_GB, CONNECTIONS, LATENCY_MS, COST_USD (storageGB × $0.35/GB-month)
- AI: COST_USD (monthly aggregate), USAGE_PERCENT (credits vs budget)

### UI Enhancements
- Trends section (30-day sparklines) for key metrics
- Export CSV of raw metrics (toolbar button)
- Preserved service cards and recommendation list

### Defaults & Alerts
- Seeded limits:
  - VERCEL_POSTGRES (Launch): COST_USD=10 (monthly storage-cost alert; usage-based, no hard caps)
  - AI_CREDITS: USAGE_PERCENT=100 (hard cap)
  - AI_OPENAI: COST_USD=50 (soft alert cap)
- Existing thresholds honored (75% warn, 90% critical)

### Issues Encountered
- Compute-hours pricing requires Neon Usage API. Implementation deferred; monitor supports storage-cost now and can extend to compute later via env-gated API call.

### Next Ideas (Proactive)
- Cost projection (linear regression) and 7/30 day forecast
- Slack/email alerts via webhooks
- Per-project breakdown for Vercel metrics (projectId metadata)

## Phase 3: Execution (in-progress)

### Implemented now
- API acceptance (402 and 429) without adding routes:
  - Added POST to existing `/api/analytics` with:
    - withRateLimit('api') + withIdempotencyRequired() + withProviderAuth()
    - `simulate: "402"` triggers wallet-style 402 payload (docs/Execute/3/MONETIZATION/model.json)
    - Budget-aware guard using `checkAiBudget(orgId, 'ai.concierge', 50)`
      - Returns 402 with `required_prepay_cents` computed from missing credits
- Typecheck passes across monorepo; changes pushed

### Remaining from acceptance
- CSV import → leads render; schedule page loads; invoice stub creates (Import Wizard UI present; wiring to batch endpoints TBD)
- Staff geofence clock-in guard (defer until route-budget confirmation or reuse existing handler)
- Portal request service form presence (reuse existing portal form or minimal addition within route budget)

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- (Optional) Provide Neon Usage API credentials to add compute-hours COST_USD into metrics
- Wire Import Wizard output to an existing batch import path (no new routes) and surface leads
- Add Slack/email alert hooks for critical thresholds
- If you want me to proceed, I will continue autonomously on the above.
