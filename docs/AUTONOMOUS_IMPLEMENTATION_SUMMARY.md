# Autonomous Implementation Summary

Date: 2025-10-08
Branch: phases/4-7-completion

## CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY (MEMORIZED)
- **Provider** = Software provider (Chris/Cortiware) → Uses Provider Portal with federation
- **Client** = Provider's customer (roofing company, HVAC contractor, etc.) → Uses Client/Owner Portal
- **Customer** = Client's end customer (homeowner, business needing services) → End consumer

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Monitoring ✅ COMPLETE

### Services Added
- NeonPostgresMonitor (VERCEL_POSTGRES): STORAGE_GB, CONNECTIONS, LATENCY_MS, COST_USD
- NeonApiClient: Fetches compute-hours usage from Neon API (env-gated)
- AiUsageMonitor (AI_OPENAI, AI_CREDITS): COST_USD, USAGE_PERCENT

### Metrics Tracked
- Postgres: STORAGE_GB, CONNECTIONS, LATENCY_MS, COST_USD
  - COST_USD = (storageGB × $0.35/GB-month) + (compute-hours × $0.14/CU-hr)
  - Env-gated: requires NEON_API_KEY, NEON_PROJECT_ID, NEON_API_BASE (optional)
  - Graceful fallback: storage-only cost when credentials absent
- AI: COST_USD (monthly aggregate), USAGE_PERCENT (credits vs budget)

### UI Enhancements
- Trends section (30-day sparklines) for key metrics
- Export CSV of raw metrics (toolbar button)
- Preserved service cards and recommendation list

### Defaults & Alerts
- Seeded limits:
  - VERCEL_POSTGRES (Launch): COST_USD=10 (monthly cost alert; usage-based, no hard caps)
  - AI_CREDITS: USAGE_PERCENT=100 (hard cap)
  - AI_OPENAI: COST_USD=50 (soft alert cap)
- Existing thresholds honored (75% warn, 90% critical)

### Environment Variables Added
- NEON_API_KEY: Personal Access Token from Neon Console
- NEON_PROJECT_ID: Project UUID from Neon Console
- NEON_API_BASE: (optional) defaults to https://console.neon.tech/api/v2

## Phase 3: API Guards & Acceptance ✅ COMPLETE

### Implemented
1. **AI 402 Guard (budget-aware)**
   - Route: POST /api/analytics (reused existing route; no new endpoints)
   - Middleware: withRateLimit('api') + withIdempotencyRequired() + withProviderAuth()
   - Two modes:
     - Acceptance stub: `{ "simulate": "402" }` → returns wallet-style 402 payload
     - Budget-aware: `{ "orgId": "..." }` → calls checkAiBudget() and returns 402 if insufficient credits
   - 402 payload format (per docs/Execute/3/MONETIZATION/model.json):
     ```json
     {
       "error": "PAYMENT_REQUIRED",
       "feature": "ai.concierge",
       "required_prepay_cents": 1500,
       "enable_path": "/provider/wallet/prepay?feature=ai.concierge&amount_cents=1500"
     }
     ```

2. **Rate Limiting (429)**
   - Applied to POST /api/analytics via withRateLimit('api')
   - Preset: 100 requests per 60 seconds
   - Returns 429 with proper headers (Retry-After, X-RateLimit-*)

### Acceptance Status
- ✅ AI 402 payload on guard (simulate mode + budget-aware mode)
- ✅ Rate limit returns 429 after threshold
- ⏳ CSV import → leads render (Import Wizard UI exists; batch wiring pending)
- ⏳ Staff geofence clock-in guard (deferred; no route budget)
- ⏳ Portal request service form (deferred; existing forms may suffice)

## Architecture Fix: Import Wizard & Roofing Takeoff ✅ COMPLETE

### Problem Identified
- Import Wizard and Roofing Takeoff were incorrectly placed in Provider Portal
- These are CLIENT tools, not PROVIDER tools
- Terminology was backwards throughout codebase

### Solution Implemented
1. **Moved Import Wizard:**
   - From: `apps/provider-portal/src/app/(provider)/import-wizard/`
   - To: `src/app/(owner)/import-wizard/`
   - Purpose: Allows CLIENTS to import their CUSTOMER data from CSV
   - Access: Owner-only, all verticals
   - Added to Owner Portal navigation

2. **Moved Roofing Takeoff:**
   - From: `apps/provider-portal/src/app/(provider)/roofing-takeoff/`
   - To: `src/app/(owner)/verticals/roofing/takeoff/`
   - Purpose: Roofing-specific measurement tool for CLIENTS
   - Access: Owner-only, roofing vertical only
   - Vertical-specific placement

3. **Navigation Updates:**
   - Removed both tools from Provider Portal (ProviderShellClient.tsx)
   - Added Import Wizard to Owner Portal navigation (OwnerShellClient.tsx)
   - Updated all comments to use correct terminology

4. **Route Count:**
   - No new routes added (just moved existing routes)
   - Stayed within 36-route cap

3. Verify portal request form presence (may already exist)
4. Add cost projection (7/30-day forecast) for infrastructure metrics
5. Add Slack/email alert hooks for critical thresholds
6. Final acceptance validation and documentation update
