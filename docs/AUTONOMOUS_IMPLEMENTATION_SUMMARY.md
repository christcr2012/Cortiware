# Autonomous Implementation Summary

Date: ${new Date().toISOString()}
Branch: phases/4-7-completion

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Monitoring

### Services Added
- NeonPostgresMonitor (VERCEL_POSTGRES): STORAGE_GB, CONNECTIONS, LATENCY_MS
- AiUsageMonitor (AI_OPENAI, AI_CREDITS): COST_USD, USAGE_PERCENT

### Metrics Tracked (new)
- Postgres: STORAGE_GB, CONNECTIONS, LATENCY_MS
- AI: COST_USD (monthly aggregate), USAGE_PERCENT (credits vs budget)

### UI Enhancements
- Trends section (30-day sparklines) for key metrics
- Export CSV of raw metrics (toolbar button)
- Preserved service cards and recommendation list

### Defaults & Alerts
- Seeded limits:
  - VERCEL_POSTGRES: STORAGE_GB=1 (hobby), CONNECTIONS=20 (hobby)
  - AI_CREDITS: USAGE_PERCENT=100 (hard cap)
  - AI_OPENAI: COST_USD=50 (soft alert cap)
- Existing thresholds honored (75% warn, 90% critical)

### Issues Encountered
- None blocking. Latency measured via trivial query; acceptable for indicative trend.

### Next Ideas (Proactive)
- Cost projection (linear regression) and 7/30 day forecast
- Slack/email alerts via webhooks
- Per-project breakdown for Vercel metrics (projectId metadata)

## Phase 2: Execute Phase 3 Bundle (Planning)

### What Phase 3 Builds
- App shells (admin web, staff mobile, customer portal)
- API gateway with vertical plug-ins
- Geofence guard, CSV lead import, portal request form
- Monetization 402 contract and rate limiting acceptance

### Extracted Requirements (docs/Execute/3/*)
- Acceptance: CSV imports surface leads, guard returns 402 for AI, rate limit yields 429
- Monetization model (tiers and 402 payload contract)

### Integration Plan (incremental)
1) Reuse existing Import Wizard (leads) to satisfy CSV acceptance for admin shell surrogate
2) Wire existing rate limit middleware (429) to AI endpoints and general API
3) Add AI cost guard helper using wallet-style 402 payload for AI concierge
4) Add minimal portal request form route in tenant-app (if within route budget) or surface in existing forms

Status: Planning staged; not yet implemented to avoid exceeding route cap without full review.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Approve/clarify scope for Phase 3 endpoints vs 36-route cap
- If approved, implement AI 402 guard and map acceptance to existing routes (no new endpoints)
- Add cost projection and alert channels for infrastructure monitoring
