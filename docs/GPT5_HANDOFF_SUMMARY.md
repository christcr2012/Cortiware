## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What NOT to Change
- ❌ Don't redesign the authentication system (it's complete and working)
- ❌ Don't change the database schema without good reason
- ❌ Don't use Pages Router (App Router only)
- ❌ Don't remove existing functionality

### What TO Focus On
- ✅ Portal architecture and navigation
- ✅ Design system with 6 themes
- ✅ Component specifications
- ✅ User experience and workflows
